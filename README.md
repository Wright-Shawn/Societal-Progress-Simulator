An **interactive, AI-assisted web tool** that explores a **toy model of societal health**.  
‚ö†Ô∏è This project is for **exploration and demonstration only ‚Äî not forecasting or policy use.**  
It also serves as a **case study in reproducibility and validation** using the Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) and Continuous Research Integration (CRI).

## Model  

The conceptual model is based on a scalar progress function:  

**P(t) = (R √ó E √ó C)^Œ± √∑ (I √ó D)^Œ≤**  

where:  
- **Fairness of Resources (R)** ‚Äî distribution of food, housing, income, healthcare  
- **Education Quality (E)** ‚Äî access to quality education and critical thinking  
- **Social Trust (C)** ‚Äî cooperation and trust among people  
- **Government Instability (I)** ‚Äî higher = more chaotic/corrupt institutions  
- **Misinformation (D)** ‚Äî higher = more fake news and propaganda  
- **Œ±, Œ≤** ‚Äî exponents tuning nonlinear sensitivity  

üìù **Note:** The current web version implements a **simplified scoring system** (linear averages of positives and negatives). The full equation is reserved for future iterations.  

This deliberate imperfection demonstrates how AI-assisted work can be logged, validated, and iteratively improved.

## Features  

- Interactive sliders for the five key drivers  
- Instant feedback on societal status (**thriving, struggling, or collapsing**)  
- Historical presets (*Ancient Rome at Peak*, *Great Depression USA*)  
- Designed as a **portfolio-grade example** of transparent AI+human orchestration
